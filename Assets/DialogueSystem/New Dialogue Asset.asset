  - Amidst the dense forest, monkeys swing from tree to tree. Suddenly, the serenity
    is shattered by distant tree crashes. Dust clouds roll in, the ground trembles,
    and an ominous factory silhouette appears in the distance. The forest's heart
    is under siege.
  - "A concerned monkey named Salsa unearths a shimmering artifact and hides it hastily.
    This artifact is a key to another time, a beacon of hope. As the factory continues
    its encroachment, Salsa's thoughts turn to an old friend \u2013 Pavo, a peacock
    with a unique past."
  - For now, something bad happened in the forest! The whole world is now Black and
    White! - Click to START
